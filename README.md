# product-category-demo

- Used mirage.js as the mock-up server 
- Since I wasn't given any public API or example JSON objects, I had to modify and create ones for myself with some improvements over the ones on the document
- Responsiveness of the components to multiple devices are ignored since it wasn't asked for on the document
- Used react-native-fast-image because PNG files I found for the products were too large so I wanted to gain some performance with it.
- If you get a network error from the mock server, disable remote debug and reload the app from the debug menu.
